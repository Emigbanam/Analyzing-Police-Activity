# Analyzing Police Activity with Pandas

## Project Description
This project explores the **Stanford Open Policing Project dataset** to understand the impact of **gender on police behavior**.

The analysis covers the complete workflow of a data science project:
- Cleaning and preparing messy real-world data
- Creating effective visualizations
- Combining and reshaping datasets
- Manipulating time series data

The project highlights how data science techniques can uncover insights about social issues, while also providing hands-on experience with **pandas** and related Python libraries.

By the end of this project, you will see how to:
- Load and clean large-scale datasets
- Explore demographic factors influencing police activity
- Visualize trends and relationships in the data
- Apply pandas operations to handle complex data structures

This project serves as a strong practice in **end-to-end data analysis**, preparing you with practical skills for your data science career.
